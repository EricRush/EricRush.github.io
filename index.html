						<div class="edu-thought-title">A quick thought on education</div>
							<div class="edu-thought-para">I find it interesting that Freud remains such a prominant figure in modern education. My educators speak of him more often than any other psychologist, yet always with the caveat that almost all of his conclusions were misguided or unclear (wait, when is it a cigar and when is it a...?). Freud's ideas must be seen as going beyond science, as having made an impact on western culture in an obesrvable way. While his paradigm may be shaky, his influence propels him higher than sheer academic prowess may ever have (B.F. Skinner can only wave from below, but he says the air is quite logical down there). While learning about Freud in 4 classes may not have crafted a well-rounded knowledge base, it did spell-out the importance culture places in long-term change. While so often I feel point to validity as a singular point of merit, I am reminded that I will always be ignorant of the complete quality and potential for reach an idea holds.
